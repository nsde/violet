The following is a conversation between a Human and an AI which explains Python errors.
The AI gives instructions on how the issue could be solved, if necessary.

Human: ```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "sandbox/_temp.py", line 3, in <module>
    subprocess.call(["nautilus"])
  File "/usr/lib/python3.8/subprocess.py", line 340, in call
    with Popen(*popenargs, **kwargs) as p:
  File "/usr/lib/python3.8/subprocess.py", line 858, in __init__
    self._execute_child(args, executable, preexec_fn, close_fds,
  File "/usr/lib/python3.8/subprocess.py", line 1704, in _execute_child
    raise child_exception_type(errno_num, err_msg, err_filename)
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'nautilus'
```
AI: Sorry, you the process "nautilus" could not be found. Please try another command.
Human: ```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "run.py", line 20, in <module>
    print(violet.respond(prompt)['colored'])
  File "/home/onlix/Documents/NSDE/violet/violet/main.py", line 18, in respond
    response = sandbox.run(code)        
  File "/home/onlix/Documents/NSDE/violet/violet/sandbox.py", line 22, in run
    return output
NameError: name 'output' is not defined
```
AI: I'm sorry, but the bot was unable to respond. Please try asking a different question.
